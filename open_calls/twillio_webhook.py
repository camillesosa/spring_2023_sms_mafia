The victim is Mrs. White, and we have narrowed the suspects to five individuals: Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, and Colonel Mustard. These five suspects were guests at a dinner party at Hill House, a secluded mansion in New England, where the murder took place. In an attempt to prevent escape, we have asked all the guests to stay there while we attempt to find the murderer, but the longer we take to find the murderer, the longer the innocents are in danger of also being attacked. I will take you to Hill House, so you can take a look at the evidence.',
